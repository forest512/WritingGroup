````

**First week task**
Give an introduction about your research, e.g. the research method, the research object or the application of the research. Introducing your research to others who don't have correlative knowledge background is meaningful. To make your writing readable, you should 1). review and summarize your research 2). explain your research in a simple and clear way. 3). show the creativeness and application of your research to attract others. Although, it seems not very easy to start your first writing. While, just do it and enjoy the writing. 

**General schedule**
* Group Meeting is held on Wednesday every week from 5:00 - 6:00 pm at Goodwin Hall 285.
* The writing manuscript is recommended to be uploaded before Sunday. 
* The comments on the others' writing could be uploaded before Tuesday.
